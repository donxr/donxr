- 👋 Hi, I’m Don
- 👀 I’m interested in the ideal MWO mech and weapon loadout.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and how to fight in a giant fighting machine.
- 💞️ Last year I was enamored with the idea of that there exists a perfect note-taking setup and even wanted to collaborate on the ultimate note-taking environment. i even wrote some notes in MD and bought that nice MD editor whose name i've forgotten.  
Then i retired.  
After all that research I still create notes in my smartphone,  emailing to self, stickies (Post-Its), Stickies for Windows, screenshots, Google Keep, OneNote, Word, Excel, PDFs, Text files, code comments, etc.  Google once said "Don't Sort, Search."  Now that the latest version of Everything has content search, i may through sheer information oppression let go entirely of the notion that there is value in organizing my records unto a single form.
- 📫 Reach me via email.
